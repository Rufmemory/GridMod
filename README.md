# GridMod
Hello dear folks! Looking for a fully modular, open source, Pygame 3d-Engine? Well this may be a good start. GridMod is capable of visualising self made three dimensional shapes, by groupping nodes, vectors and matrices, and by applying common matrix operations to those vertices we get to display those predefined 3d objects, along with a scaling, rotation, and colour factor. That is it for now, yet more is coming. Feel free to let me know if you want to ask anything, thereby suggessting what could further be done to make this even more awesome,  Or maybe even informing us on what allready has been done around similar, simple open source python3D engines.  You are definetly also welcome to simply tell me if you liked it!! # Ruf.
